<!-- Chosen Palette: Warm & Sophisticated -->
<!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is designed as a top-down interactive dashboard. It starts with a high-level summary (KPIs and key charts). The core of the app is the "Compliance Matrix Explorer," now a summary table showing one line per state. This allows for a clean high-level view. Clicking a state opens a modal with a detailed breakdown of all regulations for that jurisdiction. This two-step process (summary -> detail) facilitates a clear user flow from a macro, 50-state view to a micro, state-specific analysis. -->
<!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
- Summary Charts (Donut, Bar): Goal=Inform. These remain to provide an immediate overview of the entire dataset's status, risk, and ownership. (Chart.js/Canvas)
- State Summary Table (HTML Table + JS): Goal=Organize/Explore. Presents a summarized view of all jurisdictions. Allows users to quickly assess which states have more regulations or high-risk items. The primary interaction is clicking a row to drill down. (Vanilla JS)
- State Detail Modal (Dynamic HTML in JS): Goal=Explore/Inform. When a state row is clicked, a modal displays all detailed compliance items for that state. This fulfills the requirement for a detailed state-by-state breakdown on demand. (Vanilla JS)

<!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
